# learnNextJs-Blog

Creating a mini-blog to understand the workings of NextJs.
The doc below documents the steps I went through during the creation and learning process.

## Setup

Creating a basic env.

1. Created a Next.Js app using `create-next-app` command.
2. Command used - `npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"`
3. Open/Enter the nextjs-blog directory with `cd nextjs-blog`.
4. Run the Web-App on localhost using `npm run dev`.
5. Visit your Web-App on `localhost:3000`.

## Basics

Learning the basics of the NextJS.

### Navigating Between Pages

1. You can create new routes and pages by adding files and folders in `pages` folder.
2. For Example. `pages/posts/first-post.js` will create new page at route `localhost:3000/posts/first-post`

### Link Component

1. `<Link>` component from `next/link` allows for client-side navigation and accepts props.
2. Simply import it to your jsx file using `import Link from 'next/link';`.
3. `<Link>` is quite similar to `<a>` tag.
4. The difference is that `<Link>` allow `client-side navigation`.
5. Which basically means that, it uses javascript to load/transition to next page.
6. This allow for transition without fully reloding the page, providing a seamless experience.
7. `<Link>` also helps in `code-splitting` and `prefetching`.

### Assets, Metadata, and CSS

#### Assets

1. You can store all your assets inside `public` folder which can be accessed from root directory.
2. NextJS provides `<Image>` component out-of-the-box that provides various features like:
   a.Ensuring your image is responsive on different screen sizes
   b.Optimizing your images with a third-party tool or library
   c.Only loading images when they enter the viewport.
3. Import `<Image>` from `next/image`.

#### Metadata

1. In case you need to edit the head of the document, like changing `title`, then you can use `<Head>` component from `next/head`.
2. NextJS also provides `<Script>` tag form `next/script` that allow to include external Javascript.
3. This `<Script>` tag provides options like `lazyOnLoad` and `OnLoad` that effciently load the script in background.

#### CSS

1. Components can be shared between pages. To create components, add you code to `components` directory in `root` dir.
2. CSS modules in nextJS can be used to locally scope CSS at component level. They automatically generate unique class names to avoid class name collision.
3. To use CSS modules just add `module.css` at end of the file name. Then import it your JSX file as `styles` or any name of your preference. To use classes prefix it with `styles.` or the name of your choice. eg. `styles.container`.
4. There is also feature for Global CSS. For this you have to create `pages/_app.jsx`.
5. `_app.jsx` is a top-level React component that wraps all pages and allows to keep state when navigating pages or add global styles. (YOU NEED TO RESTART SERVER AFTER ADDING \_app.jsx)
6. You can only import global css in \_app.jsx.

### Pre-rendering and Data Fetching

There are two forms of pre-rendering :-
a. Static Site Generation
b. Server Side Rendering

#### Static Site Generation

1. It means pre-rendering a static web page which can be stored on CDN for faster page-load.
2. SSG can be done with Data and without Data.
3. With data, nextjs fetches data during build-time to create a static page. This a one time process. For pages with constant updates to data refer SSR (Server Side Rendering).
4. The pages without data are automatically generated. However of pages with data, next provide `getStaticProps` that does the data fetching and build static page.

#### Server Side Rendering

1. In SSR, the page is rendered at every request to keep the data on the website up-to-date with current data.
2. This can be achieved in NextJS using `getServerSideProps`.
3. This pre-rendering method is used to improve SEO.

#### Client Side Rendering

1. Pre-render the static part of the website and fetch data on client side.
2. This works well if SEO of the page doesn't matter, like user dashboards.
3. NextJS has hook called `SWR`specifically made for this purpose.
4. It handles caching, revalidation, focus tracking, refetching on interval, and more.

### Dynamic Routes

1. You can create dynamic routes using square brackets like `[name].jsx`. Here name is variable name of id that you'll use from array of ids.
2. You MUST pass array of objects where key is `params` which contains another object that'll store our id.
3. Example : `[
  {
    params: {
      id: 'ssg-ssr'
    }
  },
  {
    params: {
      id: 'pre-rendering'
    }
  }
]`

4. Use `getStaticPaths` to create the dynamic routes.
5. And use `getStaticProps` to fetch names of `ids` from database which can later be used to create dynamic routes.
